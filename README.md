About
=====
KS-SearchViewController is a view controller with a search bar implemented and built into the header of a UITableView. By default, the search bar is "hidden" like search bars across the UI implemented by Apple. The user must scroll down to reveal the search bar. 

Usage
=====
Added both KS_SearchViewController.h and KS_SearchViewController.m to your project. Import the header file where you want to init the view controller. 

You will need to pass a mutable array to this view controller if you want data loaded initially otherwise initialize the NSMutableArray and fill it with contents when the search view controller loads.
